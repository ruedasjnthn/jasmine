    His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for
    The kind that colors the sky
    Heart intangible, slips away faster than
    Dandelion fluff in the sunlight
    And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes
    Uncoverin' the dreams, he dreams at night
    As much and hard as he tries to hide
    I can see right through, see right through
    His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like
    I'd fade away somehow if he's too loud
    What I would give for me to get my feet
    Back on the ground, head off the clouds
    I laugh at how we're polar opposites
    I read him like a book, and he's a clueless little kid
    Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space
    Just to make him smile, make him smile
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once
    Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
    Take a chance with me, take a chance with me
    Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
    Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
    His kiss you'd kill for, just one and you're done for
    Electricity surgin' in the air
    He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me
    How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware
    That I'm hopelessly captivated
    By a boy who thinks love's overrated
    How did I get myself in this arrangement?
    It baffles me, too, baffles me, too
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once
    Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
    In the end we only regret the chances we didn't take
    I'll be your safety net, so why not raise the stakes?
    And I can hear your heart from across the room
    Pulsin' through my veins, I know you need this too
    Lie to me all you please, I can see right through
    See right through
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once
    Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once

    I laugh at how we're polar opposites
    I read him like a book, and he's a clueless little kid
    Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space
    Just to make him smile, make him smile
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once
    Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
    Take a chance with me, take a chance with me
    Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
    Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
    His kiss you'd kill for, just one and you're done for
    Electricity surgin' in the air
    He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me
    How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware
    That I'm hopelessly captivated
    By a boy who thinks love's overrated
    How did I get myself in this arrangement?
    It baffles me, too, baffles me, too
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once
    Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
    In the end we only regret the chances we didn't take
    I'll be your safety net, so why not raise the stakes?
    And I can hear your heart from across the room
    Pulsin' through my veins, I know you need this too
    Lie to me all you please, I can see right through
    See right through
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once

    Take a chance with me, take a chance with me
    Ooh-ah, oh-oh, oh
    His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for
    The kind that colors the sky
    Heart intangible, slips away faster than
    Dandelion fluff in the sunlight
    And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes
    Uncoverin' the dreams, he dreams at night
    As much and hard as he tries to hide
    I can see right through, see right through
    His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like
    I'd fade away somehow if he's too loud
    What I would give for me to get my feet
    Back on the ground, head off the clouds
    I laugh at how we're polar opposites
    I read him like a book, and he's a clueless little kid
    Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space

    In the end we only regret the chances we didn't take
    I'll be your safety net, so why not raise the stakes?
    And I can hear your heart from across the room
    Pulsin' through my veins, I know you need this too
    Lie to me all you please, I can see right through
    See right through
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once
    Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once
    Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
    Take a chance with me, take a chance with me
    Ooh-ah, oh-oh, oh
    His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for
    The kind that colors the sky
    Heart intangible, slips away faster than
    Dandelion fluff in the sunlight
    And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes
    Uncoverin' the dreams, he dreams at night
    As much and hard as he tries to hide
    I can see right through, see right through
    His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like
    I'd fade away somehow if he's too loud
    What I would give for me to get my feet
    Back on the ground, head off the clouds
    I laugh at how we're polar opposites
    I read him like a book, and he's a clueless little kid
    Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space
    Just to make him smile, make him smile
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once
    Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
    Take a chance with me, take a chance with me
    Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
    Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
    His kiss you'd kill for, just one and you're done for
    Electricity surgin' in the air
    He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me
    How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware
    That I'm hopelessly captivated
    By a boy who thinks love's overrated
    How did I get myself in this arrangement?
    It baffles me, too, baffles me, too
    Oh, why can't we for once
    Say what we want, say what we feel?
    Oh, why can't you for once
    Disregard the world, and run to what you know is real?
